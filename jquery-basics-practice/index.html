Operators- Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values. When they are, they return a Boolean value. However, the && and || operators actually return the value of one of the specified operands, so if these operators are used with non-Boolean values, they may return a non-Boolean value.
Variables-A variable is a named location for storing a value. That way an unpredictable value can be accessed through a predetermined name.
Variable naming conventions- camelCase style
Functions-Something that performs an action. It can take any argument.
Methods-A method is a function which is a property of an object/In JavaScript functions themselves are objects, so, in that context, a method is actually an object reference to a function.
Arguments-An argument is a value (primitive or object) passed as input to a function.
Parameters-A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. Parameter variables are used to import arguments into functions.
Return-The return statement ends function execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller.
Chaining methods-
Strings-The String global object is a constructor for strings or a sequence of characters.
Booleans-The Boolean object is an object wrapper for a boolean value. Its return value is either true or false.
Undefined-A primitive value automatically assigned to variables that have just been declared or to formal arguments for which there are no actual arguments.The global undefined property represents the primitive value undefined.
Primitive types- String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol
*NaN-The global NaN property is a value representing Not-A-Number.
*Escape-The escape() function computes a new string in which certain characters have been replaced by a hexadecimal escape sequence.
Alert-The Window.alert() method displays an alert dialog with the optional specified content and an OK button.
Comments- '//' is how you start a comment section, it's used to leave notes needed for code reviewing and marking bugs
jQuery-jQuery is a JavaScript Library that focuses on simplifying DOM manipulation, AJAX calls, and Event handling. jQuery uses a format, $(selector).action() to assign an element(s) to an event.
Attributes-An attribute extends a tag, changing its behavior or providing metadata. An attribute always has the form name=value (the attribute's identifier followed by its associated value).
